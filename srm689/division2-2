Problem Statement
    
You are given two Strings: A and B. Each character in A is either '0' or '1'. Each character in B is '0', '1', or '?'.   A string C matches B if we can change B into C by changing each '?' in B either to '0' or to '1'. Different occurrences of '?' may be changed to different digits. For example, C = "0101" matches B = "01??". Note that each character in C must be either '0' or '1', there cannot be any '?' remaining.   Consider all possible strings that match B. How many of these strings occur as a (contiguous) substring in A? Compute and return their number. Note that we only count each good string once, even if it has multiple occurrences in A.
Definition

256
Stack limit (MB):
256
Constraints
-
A will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.

-
Each character in B will be '0', '1' or '?'.
Examples
0)

    
"00010001"
"??"
Returns: 3
There are four strings that match B: the strings "00", "01", "10", and "11". Out of these, the string "11" does not occur in A as a substring. The other three do occur, hence the answer is 3.
1)

    
"00000000"
"??0??0"
Returns: 1
There are 16 different strings that match B, but out of those only the string "000000" is a substring of A.
2)

    
"001010101100010111010"
"???"
Returns: 8
Each of the 8 strings that match B occurs somewhere in A.
3)

    
"00101"
"??????"
Returns: 0
Here, the length of B is greater than the length of A. Clearly, a string that matches this B cannot be a substring of this A.
4)

    
"1101010101111010101011111111110001010101"
"???????????????????????????????????"
Returns: 6

Solution:

import java.util.*;
public class NonDeterministicSubstring {
	public long ways(String A, String B) {
	
		long rtn = 0;
		int n = B.length();
		
		if(n > A.length()){
			return 0;
		}
		
		//hashtable to check if it is used or not
		HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<String, Integer>(); 
		
		for(int i=0; i<A.length(); i++){
			if(i+n > A.length()){
				break;
			}

			String current = A.substring(i, i+n);
			
			boolean match = true;
			
			for(int j=0; j<n; j++){
				char a = current.charAt(j);
				char b = B.charAt(j);
				
				if(a == b || b == '?'){
					continue;
				}else{
					match = false;
					break;
				}
			}
			
			if(match){

				if(!map.containsKey(current)){
					rtn += 1;
					map.put(current, 1);
				}
			}
